## analytics_masters

Course projects, homework, and capstone draft scripts for UChicago's Masters of Science in Analytics. 

Languages:
* Python (Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing)
* R (Linear & Non Linear Models, Time Series)
* Julia (Optimization) 

Subjects: 
* [Linear & Non Linear Models](analytics_masters/nonlinearmodels_courseproj_hmm_simulation.rmd)
    * Course project exploring the DepmixS4 package for Hidden Markov Models. Simulated a dataset based on known initial values and transition probabilities then compared with the output of the package model.
* [Machine Learning](analytics_masters/machinelearning_courseproj.ipynb)
    * Course project using ML techniques to predict mental health care seekers based on survey data. Techniques applied include data exploration and cleanup, feature engineering, model application and evaluation.
* [Natural Language Processing](analytics_masters/nlp_classification_hw.ipynb)
    * Homework assignment cleaning City of Chicago restaurant inspection data and using comments to predict outcome of inspection. Techniques applied include text parsing, feature extraction with TF-IDF and CountVectorizor, model application and evaluation.
* [Optimization](analytics_masters/linear_optimization_hw.ipynb)
    * Homework assignment optimizing a linear problem with linear constraints using Julia GLPK solver.
* [Time Series](analytics_masters/timeseries_courseproj.Rmd)
    * Course project predicting global temperature change and atmospheric CO2. Techniques applied include data imputation, Holtz Winters and seasonal ARIMA model application, and evaluation.
